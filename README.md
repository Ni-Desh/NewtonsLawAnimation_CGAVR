# NewtonsLawAnimation_CGAVR
This OpenGL program visually demonstrates Newton's three laws of motion using an animated ball and forces. The user can switch between laws using keyboard keys (1, 2, 3), and observe how inertia, acceleration (F=ma), and action-reaction are illustrated with motion and force arrows.By pressing + user can increase force and using - force will be decreased.
